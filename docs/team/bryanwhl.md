###Project: ModMan
Short for Module Manager, ModMan is a desktop app designed to help teaching assistants manage their module(s). It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). ModMan helps to track module details as well as studentsâ€™ progress and data, all in one platform. It can also perform autograding for MCQ assignments.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- New Feature: Added the ability to save the user's data for his/her next use upon exiting the application.
    - What it does: Automatically saves the user's data upon exiting of the application.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can save his/her data from the particular session and will not have to input his/her past data again the next time he/she uses the app.

- New Feature: Added the ability to keep track of assignments within the app.
    - Justification: TAs often need to be the ones grading and handling assignment submissions. Adding support for tracking assignments will enhance the application drastically.
